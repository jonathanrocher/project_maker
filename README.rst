==================
Project maker tool
==================

This script's goal is to create automatically the start of a project to save
time: tree structure, fab scripts, maybe envisage framework if that option is
turned, jenkins/travisCI start file, ... My goal is to save time and capture
here most of the best practices that we are starting to put in place
company-wide. All that while avoiding the Visual Studio trap of making things
obfuscated.

Usage
-----
1. Copy the utils/config.py and customize it,
2. Run `$ python project_maker.py my_customized_config.py`
